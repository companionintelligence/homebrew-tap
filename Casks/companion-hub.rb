  # The desktop keeps its data in Application Support/companion-hub and its Cloudflare
  # tunnel token in Application Support/tunnel, beside the data folder. "tunnel" is a
  # generic name, so zap trashes only the files the Hub writes there and removes the
  # folder (and the empty certs folder the Hub creates) only when nothing else is left.
